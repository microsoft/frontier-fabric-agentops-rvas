# Coach Guide — Challenge 2: Build the Telemetry Landing Zone

> Attendee challenge: [`challenges/challenge-02-landing-zone.md`](../challenges/challenge-02-landing-zone.md)

## Snapshot

| | |
|---|---|
| **Est. time** | 1.5–2 h |
| **Difficulty** | ⭐⭐ (200) |
| **They build** | ADLS Gen2 landing zone for cost, metadata, Log Analytics exports, and diagnostics |
| **Key services** | ADLS Gen2, Azure Cost Management, Resource Graph, Log Analytics data export, Diagnostic Settings |

## Coaching objectives

Teams build a single **landing zone** for Azure signals that Fabric can read with
OneLake shortcuts. Verify the managed `costs` and `metadata` containers and
Azure-created `am-*` and `insights-*` export containers are ready for Challenge 3.

**What good looks like:** the team validates FOCUS and Resource Graph Parquet, shows the physical
`am-*` and `insights-*` containers created by Azure, confirms the Log Analytics export rule and
diagnostic setting, and records the storage account name, resource ID, and DFS endpoint.

## The reference path

Prepare the persistent Fabric identity before deployment:

1. Reuse the team's Challenge 0 Fabric workspace. If it does not exist, create it in the Fabric
  portal and assign it to the team's Fabric capacity.
2. Open **Workspace settings** > **Workspace identity** and select **+ Workspace identity**.
3. Copy the identity **Object ID**, which is the Microsoft Entra principal ID. Do not use the Fabric
  workspace ID or the identity's client ID.
4. Store it in the same `azd` environment used by the team:

```bash
cd resources/observability-ingestion
azd env select ctl-tower
azd env set FABRIC_WORKSPACE_IDENTITY_PRINCIPAL_ID <WORKSPACE_IDENTITY_OBJECT_ID>
```

There is intentionally no preflight automation for this step. Workspace identity creation is an
explicit workspace-admin action in the Fabric portal.

Deploy the ingestion asset:

```bash
cd resources/observability-ingestion
azd auth login
azd up        # env name, region (same as Challenge 0), subscription
```

`azd provision` creates the ADLS Gen2 landing zone, attaches a data export rule to the existing
Challenge 1 Log Analytics workspace, configures its diagnostic setting, and creates the Cost
Management FOCUS export. Capture outputs:

```bash
azd env get-values
```

Create an isolated environment for the one-time lab seed:

```bash
cd resources/observability-ingestion/src/scripts
python -m venv .venv
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

macOS/Linux:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run Resource Graph export:

```bash
python resource_graph_export.py \
  --subscription-id <SUBSCRIPTION_ID> \
  --storage-account <STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME> \
  --container metadata
```

Trigger the Cost Management export. The current Azure CLI `costmanagement export` group may not expose
a `run` command, so use the ARM action directly:

```bash
EXPORT_NAME=export-<env-name>-focus-daily
SCOPE="/subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION_ID>"

az rest --method post \
  --url "https://management.azure.com${SCOPE}/providers/Microsoft.CostManagement/exports/${EXPORT_NAME}/run?api-version=2023-11-01"
```

Check export execution history:

```bash
az costmanagement export show \
  --name "$EXPORT_NAME" \
  --scope "$SCOPE"
```

Validate the landing zone:

```bash
python validate_exports.py \
  --storage-account <STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME>
```

## Checkpoint verification

Ask the team to show:

1. **Storage account** with hierarchical namespace enabled and managed containers `costs` and
  `metadata`.
2. **FOCUS cost Parquet** under `costs/focus/...` after trigger/wait.
3. **Resource Graph Parquet** under `metadata/resource-graph/year=*/month=*/day=*/`.
4. **Log Analytics data export** enabled for `AppRequests`, `AppDependencies`, `AppTraces`,
   `AppExceptions`, and `AppMetrics`.
5. Azure-created **Log Analytics containers** such as `am-apprequests`, `am-appdependencies`, and
  `am-appmetrics` after fresh Challenge 1 traffic.
6. Azure-created **diagnostic containers** with `insights-*` names after platform telemetry is emitted.
7. **Diagnostic setting** on the reused Log Analytics workspace targets storage and Log Analytics.
8. `validate_exports.py` output with file counts, sizes, latest timestamps, and sample schemas.
9. Recorded Fabric coordinates:
   - storage account name
   - storage account resource ID
   - `https://<storage-account>.dfs.core.windows.net`

✅ Pass when the storage landing zone is validated and the team can explain how Challenge 3 will
shortcut to it.

## Common pitfalls & fixes

| Pitfall | Fix |
|---|---|
| `FABRIC_WORKSPACE_IDENTITY_PRINCIPAL_ID` is missing | Create the identity under **Workspace settings** > **Workspace identity**, copy its **Object ID**, and store it with `azd env set` |
| Storage role assignment targets the wrong ID | Use the workspace identity **Object ID**, not the Fabric workspace ID or managed identity client ID |
| Missing **Cost Management Reader** | Grant at the billing/subscription scope; Contributor on the resource group is not enough for cost exports |
| `costs` container empty | Cost export is daily; trigger it manually with the ARM `run` action and wait for execution to complete |
| Cost export name unknown | It is `export-<environmentName>-focus-daily` from `infra/main.bicep`; confirm with `az costmanagement export list --scope /subscriptions/<id>` |
| Expecting Log Analytics export to backfill | Data export is continuous from enablement forward; generate Challenge 1 traffic after enabling it |
| Assuming data export requires a dedicated cluster | It does not for this reference path; verify the rule is enabled and treat it as continuous export |
| Storage access denied from scripts | Ensure the caller/identity has Storage Blob Data Contributor on the storage account or resource group |
| Expected `am-*` container is absent | Confirm the data export rule is enabled, generate fresh Challenge 1 traffic, and allow time for export latency; data export does not backfill |
| Expected `insights-*` container is absent | Confirm the diagnostic setting is enabled and wait for the corresponding platform log or metric category to emit data |

## Talking points (mini-briefing)

- **FOCUS standardizes cost fields** so spend can be joined to tags,
  resources, services, and agent namespaces.
- **One landing zone** makes cost, logs, metrics, metadata, and diagnostics
  queryable together rather than through separate portals.
- **Date partitions support Spark processing.** The storage layout is already shaped for Fabric notebooks and
  medallion processing.
- **Continuous vs batch matters.** Log Analytics and diagnostics stream continuously; cost is a
  scheduled Azure export; Resource Graph is seeded once for the workshop.
- **This is Challenge 3's shortcut target.** OneLake uses the storage DFS endpoint to access the data
  without copying it.

## If they finish early

- Add tags (`team`, `agent`, `environment`, `costCenter`) to Challenge 1 resources, rerun Resource
  Graph export, and prove tags appear in Parquet.
- Generate more agent traffic and watch the relevant `am-*` containers grow.
- Compare `ResourceId` in FOCUS with `id` in Resource Graph and sketch the future `dim_resource` join.
- Review [`docs/architecture.md`](../docs/architecture.md) Gold tables and map which raw container
  feeds each one.
