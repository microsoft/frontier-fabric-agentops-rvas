> Full-stack AI agent runtime with application observability from the backend to model inference.

## Architecture Overview

The **Agents Runtime** processes requests across three microservices and persists conversation data.
Application telemetry begins at
the backend; the frontend is not instrumented in this reference workload.

| Component | Role |
|---|---|
| **Azure AI Foundry** | Provides the `gpt-5-mini` model endpoint for agent inference via a managed deployment. |
| **Azure Container Apps** | Hosts three microservices — frontend, backend, and agent — in a shared managed environment with built-in autoscaling. |
| **Azure API Management** | Provisions API definitions and policies for future gateway integration; it is not in the reference application's active request path. |
| **Azure Cosmos DB** | Stores conversations, individual interactions, and agent configuration using a serverless throughput model. |
| **Application Insights** | Backend and agent request traces, dependency maps, and custom token and latency metrics. |

## Prerequisites

| Tool | Version | Install |
|---|---|---|
| Azure Subscription | Contributor access | [azure.com](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) |
| Azure CLI (`az`) | 2.60+ | `brew install azure-cli` or [docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) |
| Azure Developer CLI (`azd`) | 1.10+ | `curl -fsSL https://aka.ms/install-azd.sh \| bash` |
| Docker Desktop | Latest | [docker.com](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) |
| Node.js | 20+ | `nvm install 20` or [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) |
| Python | 3.12+ | `pyenv install 3.12` or [python.org](https://www.python.org/) |

## Quick Start

```bash
# Authenticate with Azure
azd auth login

# Initialize the environment (first time only)
azd init

# Provision infrastructure and deploy all services
azd up
```

Docker must be running. `azd up` is the normal path when containers can download packages from npm
and PyPI. If a restricted network blocks local container package downloads, run `azd provision`,
build the `agent`, `backend`, and `frontend` images as `latest` with `az acr build`, and attach them
with new Container Apps revisions. See the Challenge 1 coach guide for the exact fallback commands.

After deployment completes, `azd` prints the service URLs:

```
  frontend  https://frontend.<env>.<region>.azurecontainerapps.io
  backend   https://backend.<env>.<region>.azurecontainerapps.io
  agent     https://agent.<env>.<region>.azurecontainerapps.io
```

Run `azd env get-values` and record the Application Insights, Log Analytics, and Cosmos DB
coordinates for the following challenge.

## Monitoring & Observability

### Application Insights Integration

Application telemetry begins at the backend. The backend and agent use the **Azure Monitor
OpenTelemetry SDK** for inbound requests, outbound HTTP dependencies, Azure SDK dependencies, and
custom metrics. The frontend is not instrumented.

#### Distributed Tracing

Inbound backend requests create trace context that flows through the instrumented service chain:

```
Backend → Agent → Azure OpenAI
  └────────────→ Cosmos DB
```

Request and dependency spans include:
- HTTP method, URL, and status code
- Duration and dependency details
- Operation and trace correlation identifiers

**View traces:** Azure Portal → Application Insights → Transaction search → filter by operation name.

#### Application Map

The Application Map automatically discovers service dependencies and displays:
- Request rates and failure rates between services
- Average response times per dependency
- Cosmos DB and Azure OpenAI as external dependencies

**View the map:** Azure Portal → Application Insights → Application map.

#### Custom Metrics

The agent service emits custom metrics for model usage:

| Metric | Description |
|---|---|
| `agent.invocations` | Count of agent invocations (sync + stream) |
| `agent.tokens.prompt` | Prompt tokens consumed per request |
| `agent.tokens.completion` | Completion tokens generated per request |
| `agent.duration_ms` | End-to-end model inference duration |

**View metrics:** Azure Portal → Application Insights → Metrics → select custom namespace.

#### Live Metrics

Monitor real-time request rates, failure rates, and dependency durations during the RVAS.

**View live metrics:** Azure Portal → Application Insights → Live metrics.

#### Log Analytics (KQL)

Confirm named backend and agent requests:

```kql
AppRequests
| where TimeGenerated > ago(30m)
| project TimeGenerated, AppRoleName, Name, OperationId, ResultCode, Success
| order by TimeGenerated desc
```

Confirm correlated service, model, and Cosmos DB dependencies:

```kql
AppDependencies
| where TimeGenerated > ago(30m)
| project TimeGenerated, AppRoleName, Name, Target, OperationId, ResultCode, Success
| order by TimeGenerated desc
```

Confirm token and latency metrics:

```kql
AppMetrics
| where TimeGenerated > ago(30m) and Name startswith "agent."
| summarize Value=sum(Sum) by Name, bin(TimeGenerated, 5m)
| order by TimeGenerated desc
```

### Cosmos DB Query Metrics

Cosmos DB request units (RU) and latency are captured as dependency telemetry in Application Insights. Filter dependencies by type `Azure DocumentDB` to analyze:

- RU consumption per query
- Latency distribution (p50, p95, p99)
- Throttled requests (HTTP 429)

### APIM Analytics Dashboard

APIM is provisioned but is not in the reference application's active request path. Its analytics
will remain empty until clients are explicitly routed through the APIM gateway.

API Management provides built-in analytics:

- **Requests:** Total calls, success/failure rates, response times by API and operation
- **Geography:** Request distribution by region
- **Errors:** Top failing operations with error details
- **Capacity:** Gateway utilization and backend health

**View analytics:** Azure Portal → API Management → Analytics.

## Infrastructure

The infrastructure is defined in Bicep modules under `infra/`:

| Module | Resources Provisioned |
|---|---|
| `main.bicep` | Orchestrates modules; creates Azure AI Services, the `gpt-5-mini` deployment, managed identity, Key Vault, and role assignments |
| `container-apps.bicep` | ACR, Container Apps Environment, three Container Apps, scaling rules, and ACR pull assignment |
| `cosmos-db.bicep` | Cosmos DB account (serverless), `agentsdb` database, `conversations` and `interactions` containers with partition keys |
| `api-management.bicep` | APIM instance, API definitions, and rate-limit/CORS policies for future gateway integration |
| `monitoring.bicep` | Log Analytics workspace and workspace-based Application Insights instance |
